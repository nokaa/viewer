# Viewer
A fancy CLI file viewer

### TODO
- Comment code
- Consider adding gutter with line numbers
- Work with handling `\t` in a better way
- We can only move by lines in the file, so if a line is
excessively long, we would not be able to see all of it. It
might be good to be able to move up by one UI line as well.
